## ❓ FAQ

### Q: Why can't I add transactions to October?
**A:** Past months are read-only to preserve historical accuracy. You can only add transactions to the current month. If you need to add a past transaction, you'll need to do it through the "All Transactions" screen.

### Q: How do I see all my transactions from all months?
**A:** Tap "See All" on the home screen. This shows all transactions regardless of month, with filters and search.

### Q: What happens when the month changes?
**A:** On December 1st, December automatically becomes the current month. November becomes read-only. The app always defaults to the current month.

### Q: Can I delete a transaction from a past month?
**A:** Not from the home screen (it's read-only). But you can use "See All" → Find the transaction → Delete it.

### Q: How far back can I view?
**A:** The month picker shows the last 12 months. But all your data is stored, so you can access older months through "All Transactions".

### Q: Do budgets work per month?
**A:** Yes! Budgets have start and end dates. When you view a month, you see budgets active in that period.
