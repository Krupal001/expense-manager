## ⚡ Pro Tips

### 1. Start with Major Categories
Don't create budgets for everything at once. Start with:
- ✅ Food (usually the biggest variable expense)
- ✅ Transport (if you commute)
- ✅ Entertainment (easy to overspend)

### 2. Set Realistic Limits
- Check Analytics screen for past spending
- Add 10-15% buffer for unexpected expenses
- Example: If you spent ₹7,000 on food last month, set budget to ₹8,000

### 3. Review Weekly
- Every Sunday, check budget status
- Adjust spending for remaining days
- Edit budgets if consistently over/under

### 4. Use Date Ranges Wisely
- **Monthly**: Aligns with salary (1st to 30th)
- **Weekly**: For tighter control (Mon to Sun)
- **Custom**: For specific goals (vacation budget: Dec 15 - Dec 25)

### 5. Respond to Alerts Immediately
- **Orange warning** = Time to slow down
- **Red alert** = Review what went wrong
- Don't ignore - they're there to help!

## ❓ FAQ

### Q: Do I need to set budgets for all categories?
**A:** No! Only set budgets for categories where you want to control spending. Income categories don't need budgets.

### Q: What happens when I exceed a budget?
**A:** You'll see a red alert notification. You can still add expenses, but you'll know you're over budget. It's a warning, not a restriction.

### Q: Can I have multiple budgets for the same category?
**A:** Yes, but only one can be active at a time. Use different date ranges for different periods.

### Q: Does deleting a budget delete my expenses?
**A:** No! Expenses are separate. Deleting a budget only removes the limit tracking.

### Q: How is "spent amount" calculated?
**A:** Automatically from all **debit** (expense) transactions in that category within the budget date range. Income (credit) transactions don't count.

### Q: Can I change the budget period?
**A:** Yes! Edit the budget and update the start/end dates. The system will recalculate spending for the new period.
